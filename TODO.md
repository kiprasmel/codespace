# TODO

if not in bare repo workflow:
- [ ] prefix each new worktree with the base-repo id
	- e.g. if base repo is `/org/repo`, then worktree with name `foobar` should be named `repo_foobar` instead of just `foobar`

- [ ] work out the "--bare" repo setup & confirm works
- [ ] test (bats?) to confirm behavior works / avoid regressions
