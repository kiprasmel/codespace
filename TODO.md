# TODO

- [ ] work out the "--bare" repo setup & confirm works
- [ ] test (bats?) to confirm behavior works / avoid regressions

- [ ] post-create.hidden-remove-local-files
  - e.g., if a project has a global & committed CLAUDE.md, but i don't like it, and don't want to modify it either
  - so instead i just want to remove it, and if i want to, i'll create one myself, or copy & edit to my liking, and store in layer2 (config dir)
